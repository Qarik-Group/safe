# New Features

- `safe init` is a new command that lets you initialize a new
  Vault with custom keying configuration, greatly simplifying
  standup operations.

- `safe rekey` now features the same flags as `safe init` for
  consistency and uniformity.

# Improvements

- Remove silly debugging statement that escaped into the wild.
