# Improvements

- Updated `safe cert` to default to the `default` role created by `safe pki init`
- Simplified `safe cert` so that you **must** specify the CN for the cert via `--cn`.
  Previously it auto-determined the CN based off of the PATH specified, which was confusing.
- `safe pki init` no longer prompts you for the default TTL/max TTL.
  It defaults to '10y', and allows you to override that via the `--ttl` flag.
- `safe pki init` configures the initial PKI role to allow cert generation
  for all CNs.

# Bug Fixes

- Removed extraneous messaging when `safe` iterates over mounted backends
